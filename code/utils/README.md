**Introduction**

The idea behind our project is to try and outperform the classification accuracy on the   achieved in the following two papers: 

[Multi-Channel Transfer Learning of Chest X-ray Images for Screening of COVID-19](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/9/1388/htm) (1)
Which was published in 2020, and
[Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29474911/) (2)
which was published in feb 2018
In these papers, they got classification accuracy of 

Reference | Model | Accuracy
------------ | ------------ | -------------
1 | Ensemble of multiple models | 96.4%
1 | Resnet18 | 94.3%
2 | Inception V3 | 92.8%
